## Supabase Fork

This is a Supabase fork of Phoenix Framework, published to npm as `@supabase/phoenix`.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @supabase/phoenix
```

**Releases**: This fork uses automated releases via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for details.

**Upstream**: Based on [phoenixframework/phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)

## Versioning

This package uses **independent semantic versioning** for the JavaScript client.

- **Based on**: Phoenix Framework 1.8.3 JS client
- **Last synced**: 2026-02-17

We version based on **JS API changes only**, not upstream Phoenix framework releases.
When we merge upstream Phoenix changes, we evaluate the JS API impact and version accordingly.

## Getting started

See the official site at <https://www.phoenixframework.org/>.

Install the latest version of Phoenix by following the instructions at <https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix>.

## Documentation

API documentation is available at <https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix>.

Phoenix.js documentation is available at <https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js>.

### Generating a Phoenix project from unreleased versions

You can create a new project using the latest Phoenix source installer (the `phx.new` Mix task) with the following steps:

1. Remove any previously installed `phx_new` archives so that Mix will pick up the local source code. This can be done with `mix archive.uninstall phx_new` or by simply deleting the file, which is usually in `~/.mix/archives/`.
2. Copy this repo via `git clone https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix` or by downloading it
3. Run the `phx.new` Mix task from within the `installer` directory, for example:

```bash
cd phoenix/installer
mix phx.new dev_app --dev
```

The `--dev` flag will configure your new project's `:phoenix` dep as a relative path dependency, pointing to your local Phoenix checkout:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:phoenix, path: "../..", override: true},
```

To create projects outside of the `installer/` directory, add the latest archive to your machine by following the instructions in [installer/README.md](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/main/installer/README.md)

### Building from source
